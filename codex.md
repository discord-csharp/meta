As a ranked member of the guild, your goal should be to promote a welcoming, helpful, and enjoyable environment. Every moderation action that you take should be taken with this goal in mind. We want people to come, stay, and contribute in our community. With that in mind, when moderating is necessary, please try to adhere to the following guidelines:

• Always give a verbal warning in public before any further action. Keep record of any private DMs.

• If you are asked to drop/stop a discussion, please drop it. If you need to discuss the situation, then talk to staff via DM.

• If a user persists after a verbal warning, !warn them publicly. (!warn @user Broke the rules)

• In a heated situation, start by temporarily muting the parties involved for a short period, typically 10 minutes (!tempmute @user 10m Heated discussion). Your goal should be to de-escalate the situation the best you can.

• If someone has been found to be repeatedly disruptive in chat, a longer !tempmute for 24 hours should be considered before escalating to a ban.

• We want members to be a part of our community. But, the ban hammer exists for a reason. Use it only when it is clear that a user is unwilling to follow the guild's rules. Tell the user who they should message to appeal the decision. Very rarely should a ban occur after a first violation. There are instances where this is appropriate:
    ◦ Explicit sexual content
    ◦ Racial slurs
    ◦ Gross violation of Discord ToS / Guidelines

• If someone has grossly violated the Discord ToS and a report to Discord is desired, be sure to mark the "Report to Discord" checkbox if you delete their messages. Discord does not store deleted messages, and will not act on them if removed otherwise.

• If you're unsure, ask another Moderator for input before you take action on someone. Actions provoke often unfavourable reactions.

• Be detailed when explaining your actions, the more information the better.

• Rules are to be enforced equally, regardless of a user's rank or contributions.

• If you have a question or want to find out more about a staff's/operator's action against a user, DM them. Please do not jump in abruptly or "dogpile" any user at any time.

• If you feel that a user needs help outside the context of this server, do not try to handle it yourself. Report them to reports@discordapp.com .

General flow of moderation: verbal warning, !warn, !tempmute, !ban. If a command is not available to you, escalate to the next rank up. When in doubt, follow https://discordapp.com/guidelines
